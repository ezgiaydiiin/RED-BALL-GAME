# RED-BALL-GAME
This is a red ball game which I created for my school project. I used HTML and JavaScript. I was inspired by TETRIS game and the bubble popping game which I played when I was a kid. 
The point of this game is that you should avoid blue balls and blue borders to win. When you finish 1 minute without touching any of balls or border, the page will send you a message tells you that you win. If you touch the blue balls or borders, you will lose. If you want to play again, you have to refresh the page. The blue obstacles will show up in random places and in time their number will increase. I can control this case with engelYarat() and engelHareket() functions.
